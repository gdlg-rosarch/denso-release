Description: Packages in the densowave suite provide controller functionality for Denso Wave's industrial manipulators. ORiN (Open Robot interface for the Network) is a unified network interface for industrial robot applications and has been stably utilized in Denso's manipulators for years. Controllers in this package suite uses b-CAP, TCP/UDP-based control protocol defined in ORiN, and because of its demonstrated stability, this package realizes product level reliable communication. Also, as genuine ROS package, it enables robot application developers to access full ROS features. MoveIt! configuration package is also included for some of Denso's robots.
